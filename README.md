# Neural Network with Numpy

Design a neural network for recognition digit numbers MNIST classification datasets with 10 class from 0-9.

Build the neural network with the following `Make Your Own Neural Network` book and the `Introduction to Machine Learning` course in HCMUS.

Architecture:

# I. Packages
- numpy
- tensorflow
- matplotlib

# II. The Neural Network
## Architecture

## Feedforward

## Backpropagation

## Gradient Descent


# III. Command to train the neural network
```bash
python train.py --hidden_size 50 50 --batch_size 32 --lr 0.1 --epochs 10 --activation_function sigmoid
```
- `hidden_size` is the number of hidden layers in the network
- `batch_size` is the number of instances each bath
- `lr` is the learning rate 
- `epochs` is the number of epochs to train the network
- `activation_function` sigmoid, ReLU, DReLU
